Use latest FW + VENDOR available for your device variant, not following this will result in random weird bug :D

* Skipped April 2020 because why not, May 2020 Security patches and such, more shit to do and use yeah
* Fingerprint-On-Display 1.1
* RapidGC support
* DC-Dimming 
* Face Unlock
* Proper round corner (Thanks to Abhishek)
* Addressed some denials
* Tons of under the hood improvement working on logic and such.
* Solution for WhatsApp audio is to flash aml_test.zip (Search for it on XDA), it works I guess?


PS no 1 : DC Dimming does not go well with FOD, if you have problem with FOD then just disable it.
PS no 2 : idk what to ps, enjoy
