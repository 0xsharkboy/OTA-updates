Note : If you were using Magisk, uninstall Magisk fully first by "completely uninstall" from the Magisk application, it should automatically reboot to finalize the uninstallation. Do remember that restoring just the original boot image will not do! Please do this before downloading and installing the update if you do not want to factory reset. This issue is still being worked on as we do not have enough information on this issue. Magisk remains unsupported.
