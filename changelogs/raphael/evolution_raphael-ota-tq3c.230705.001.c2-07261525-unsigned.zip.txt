This is Android 13 with July 2023 (r66) security patches

Notes:
==============================
- Set Google Maps, Camera apps and any app with 3rd party with camera access to 60hz in per app refresh rate settings if you experience lag.
- Always dirty flash at your own risk. If your device bootloops, revert to an older build that boots, backup your stuff and do a clean flash.
- Latest unofficial OFOX (decrypted), Official OFOX/TWRP (encrypted) are all supported.
- Turn off blur toggle and reboot if you're experiencing UI glitches.
- Turn on Lab in Leica camera, restart the app then turn off Parallel processing to fix normal captures.
- Double tap to wake will be fixed in the future. Use Lift to wake for now.
