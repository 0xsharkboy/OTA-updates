This is Android 13 with November 2022 (r13) security patches

Notes:
==============================
- Set Google Maps, Camera apps and any app with 3rd party with camera access to 60hz in per app refresh rate settings if you experience lag
- Dirty flash from Android 12.1 to Android 13 at your own risk. Dirty flash from older A13 builds is fine.
- If your device bootloops, revert to an older build that boots, backup your stuff and do a clean flash.
- Wrapped key is now supported. Kindly switch to the official version of OFOX or TWRP and flash DFE after the ROM if totally necessary.
- If your build bootloops, revert to the previous update, backup your files, flash the latest update then format data.
