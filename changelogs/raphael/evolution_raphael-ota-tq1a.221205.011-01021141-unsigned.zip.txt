This is Android 13 with December 2022 (r16) security patches

Notes:
==============================
- Set Google Maps, Camera apps and any app with 3rd party with camera access to 60hz in per app refresh rate settings if you experience lag
- Always dirty flash at your own risk.
- If your device bootloops, revert to an older build that boots, backup your stuff and do a clean flash.
- Wrapped key is now supported. Kindly switch to the official version of OFOX or TWRP and flash DFE after the ROM if totally necessary.
